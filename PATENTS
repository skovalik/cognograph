Additional Grant of Patent Rights

"Software" means the Cognograph software distributed by Stefan Kovalik.

Stefan Kovalik hereby grants to each recipient of the Software ("you") a
perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use,
offer to sell, sell, import, transfer, and otherwise run, modify, and
propagate the contents of this implementation of the Software, where such
license applies only to those patent claims, both currently owned or
controlled by Stefan Kovalik and acquired in the future, licensable by
Stefan Kovalik that are necessarily infringed by this implementation of the
Software. This grant does not include claims that would be infringed only
as a consequence of further modification of this implementation. If you or
your agent or exclusive licensee institute or order or agree to the
institution of patent litigation or any other patent enforcement action
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
alleging that this implementation of the Software or any code incorporated
within this implementation of the Software constitutes direct or
contributory patent infringement, or inducement of patent infringement,
then any patent rights granted to you under this Grant of Patent Rights
for the Software shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
